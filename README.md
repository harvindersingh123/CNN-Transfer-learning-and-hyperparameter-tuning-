## Transfer Learning with VGG16: A CNN-Based Model with Hyperparameter Tuning

This project demonstrates the use of Transfer Learning with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, specifically VGG16, to solve an image classification task. The workflow incorporates hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models to accelerate training, reduce computational cost, and achieve better results, especially when limited data is available.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized neural network designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically extract hierarchical features from input data, making them highly effective for image-related tasks.

## Transfer Learning
Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model, such as VGG16, is adapted to solve a different but related problem. By reusing the knowledge from a pre-trained model, transfer learning reduces the training time and computational resources needed.

## VGG16
VGG16 is a deep CNN architecture developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford. It consists of 16 layers (13 convolutional and 3 fully connected) and is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. VGG16 is renowned for its simplicity and effectiveness in feature extraction.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter Tuning involves optimizing the parameters that control the training process (e.g., learning rate, batch size, optimizer type) to improve model performance. This project uses techniques like grid search and random search to explore the best hyperparameter configurations.
